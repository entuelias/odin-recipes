    <p>A food recipe is a set of instructions detailing how to prepare a specific dish. It typically includes a list of
        ingredients, the quantities needed, and step-by-step directions for cooking or assembling the dish. Recipes can
        vary widely in complexity and cuisine, catering to different tastes and dietary needs. They serve as a guide for
        both novice and experienced cooks to create delicious meals.</p>
